		The org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory is the actual representation of the Spring IoC container that is responsible for containing 
		and otherwise managing the aforementioned beans. The BeanFactory interface is the central IoC container interface in Spring. Its responsibilities 
		include instantiating or sourcing application objects, configuring such objects, and assembling the dependencies between these objects. There are 
		a number of implementations of the BeanFactory interface that come supplied straight out-of-the-box with Spring. The most commonly used 
		BeanFactory implementation is the XmlBeanFactory class. This implementation allows you to express the objects that compose your application, 
		and the doubtless rich interdependencies between such objects, in terms of XML. The XmlBeanFactory takes this XML configuration metadata and 
		uses it to create a fully configured system or application.
